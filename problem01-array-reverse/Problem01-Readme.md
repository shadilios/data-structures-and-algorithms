Write a function that takes an array as an attribute, and return that array reversed.

## Whiteboard Process

Please note that after asking my instructor, she told me that it's ok if I solve it with actual code without resulting into any whiteboard details.

My instructor told me to add some comments explaining my code, and I did that inside the script itself.

Solution will be inside a function called ReverseArray(), and I left some extra details in Main to test my solution, you can change the inputArray values to anything you want and run the code to see that array reversed
